# Information regarding the four projects for ENGR 4510 and ENGR 4520 - Senior Engineering Design I and II


## Project 1 - Pump
Semester I

This project was focused on the principles of fluid dynamics and creating a pump system which could be used to displace a specific amount of water. More detailed information in the Design Report in the Project 1 - Pump directory.

## Project 2 - Traffic Light
Semester I

This project was focused on engineering a pedestrian traffic light system which could possibly be implemented at Austin Peay State University between the Sundquist and Maynard buildings. This project takes into account human and vehicular traffic, as well as the multiple possible situations (or states) that the crosswalk could be in. More detailed information in the Design Report in the Project 1 - Traffic Light directory.


## Project 3 - Speed Reducer
Semester II

This project was focused on providing hands on experience with construction and assembly of a speed reducer. The speed reducer is made from additive materials, wood, and rubber bands, and has an overall speed reduction ratio of 10 to 1. More detailed information in the Design Report in the Project 3 - Speed Reducer directory.


## Capstone Project - Tire Shredder
Semester I and II

This ongoing capstone project spanned both semesters and was done as a collaboration with Hanook Tires Inc. and their team located in Clarksville, TN. The goal of this project was to provide a solution to the unusable tire waste being produced by mistakes in Hankook's production. This solution came to be an on-site tire shredding system which will take any size tire that Hankook produces and shred it down to a granular or a powder form. Included are various Engineered floorplans, initial presentation explaining the process and goals of the shredder, and various design calculations.
