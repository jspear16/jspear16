# Information regarding the four projects for ENGR 4000 - Computational Physics

Fortran 95 was used for this course.

## Project 1 - Wave Equation
This project was focused on the 3 dimensional wave equation for a hydrogen atom, and how to approximate the energy level of the atom using Euler's Method and Verlet's Method. The exact solution to the second order differential equation is known and therefore used to compare the numerical method with. Sample Output for n=4, l=0:

## Project 2 - Celestial Bodies
This project was focused on estimating the locations of various bodies (primarily the planets) in our solar system using Verlet and the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta Methods. The initial position data was acquried from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory website, and the data for the numerical methods was found from the 3 dimensional laws of gravity. Two sample outputs:

## Project 3 - Manifold Propagation
This project was focused on being able to model the propogation of a wave through various types of finite manifolds. In some cases there was no impedence to the wave, while in others, a portion of the manifold was given an impedence. Both would then be modeled over time. Two sample outputs:

## Project 4 - Ferromagnets and Paramagnets
This project was focused on using the Monte-Carlo method to approximate certain characteristics related to the critical temperature, such the the electric and magnetic properties of a material. Heat Capacity is also approximated using this approach. Two sample outputs:

## Final Project - Simply Supported Beam
This project was a student picked project, and is focused on some of the principles found in a mechanics of materials class. The deflection curves and sresses found in the x-z cross section of a beam given a uniformly distributed load are modeled. Basic principles of finite element analysis are used for the 2D stress projection. Two sample outputs:
