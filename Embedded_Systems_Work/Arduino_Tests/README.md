# Project Description
The purpose of this project was to combine a few different electronic components and to create a machine which can be pointed at an object, and give the distance from the machine to that object. This project has thorough documentation found inside of the **Arduino_Tests** directory. In this directory, there are various .cpp, .ino, and .md files. All of these are related to the *Seven_Segment_Display* and the *LCD_Display* projects, both of which perform the same task, just with different displays.

The information is further explained using the doxygen documentation. To get to the initial page of the doxygen documentation, go to the file **Arduino_Tests/Dox--Arduino_Tests/html/index.html** and this will take you to the index of the documentation.
