# Description
The purpose of this directory is to give a little information about my personal life, as I am a fairly open person and don't mind talking about my personal life. I am interested in a broad variety of activities, and this directory will serve to give a snapshot of this side of my life to anyone who is interested.

As this is about my personal life, I intend for this directory to be much less formal than the rest of the jspear16 repository.

The image below was taken of me and some friends at the Desert View station of the Grand Canyon.

One thing I like doing when I have free time is to be in nature. One thing that I have found interest in is Bow Fishing, as shown below.
