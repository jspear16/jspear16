# Project Description
This project was made using the Arduino and HCSR04 Sensor and created a simple radar with the data from the hardware. Using the code for the processing language (found in **Radar_Processing**), a graphic can be made on a computer screen. The arduino code for the rotation of the sensor and the analysis of the data can be found in **Random_Radar**.

The full extent of this project was never realized. The current project design only takes into account the front facing sensor. Upgrades to the project would include a second snesor which faces the back, allowing for a full 360 degree sweep of the area. Given more time, doxygen documentation would also be produced.
