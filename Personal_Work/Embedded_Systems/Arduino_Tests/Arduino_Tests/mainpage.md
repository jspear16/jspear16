## Introduction

These are two similar but seperate projects to display the information of the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor. This sensor finds the distance to an object and displays it to either 
an LCD screen or a Seven Segment display, depending on the file used. 

To build this project, go to \ref installation "Project Requirements" to get started.

There are two projects documented in this documentation:
1. \ref LCD_Project "LCD Project"
2. \ref Seven_Project "Seven Segment Display Project"

Both of these projects accomplish the same task, just using two different displays. For ease, they have been seperated into two files with two seperate Arduino Pin connections.
