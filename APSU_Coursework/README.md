# APSU-Coursework Overview
Various projects compiled together from different classes throughout my time at Austin Peay State University. This repository serves as a collection of all the projects I deem worthy of sharing with others.

This repository is structured by course, and in each course directory there are various projects. Listed below is an overview of this repository.

## CSCI 2000
Introduction to Computer Programming using c++

This class was focused on teaching the fundamentals of procedural and object-oriented programming. In this directory, you will find four projects from my introduction to programming class, each one highlighting different programming concepts. 


## CSCI 3250
Data Structures and Algorithms

This class was focused on teaching the different data structures which can be used to organize data, the fundamentals of algorithm design, and the critical thought behind optimizing a program to be resource efficient.


## CSCI 4805
Computer Science Capstone (UNINISHED)

This class is currently ongoing as of 4/27/21. The focus of this class was to have small groups pool their expertise and knowledge together for a large, semester-long project aimed at providing experience for real-world software development.


## ENGR 4000
Computational Methods

This class was focused on utilizing the fundamental understandings of programming to solve complicated physics problems using numerical methods. With this course we discussed various different numerical methods and applied them to a number of different problems, as well as learned how to manage the systems resources to improve process time.


## ENGR 4510-4520
Senior Engineering Design I & II

These two classes were focused on the Engineering Design process and applying much of what we have learned throughout our time in the Engineering Physics program to to real world problems.
