# Information regarding the four projects for CSCI 3250 - Data Structures and Algorithms
  
C++ was used in this class. 

## Assignment 1 - Vector

This project uses vectors to add functionality to a planets list, and allows for more efficient use of the program by creating our own vector class. Using the vector class, it is possible to dynamically change the size of the planet list, which is the main function of a vector object. Output is information regarding the planets. Sample output:

To run this file, use the .exe file in its directory.

## Assignment 2 - Linked List
Building off of assignment 1, this project uses linked lists to add even more functionality to the original project. Using linked list, new funcitions such as "addBack" and "addFront" are utilized, which is a feature only possible with doubly linked list. Output is information regarding the planets. Sample Output:

To run this file, use the .exe file in its directory.

## Assignment 3 - Infix to Prefix
This program utilizes the LinkedList and Stack Data Structures to convert an equation in infix notation (normal mathematical structure where the operator appears in between the two operands) to prefix notation (operators appear before the two operands). Output is a string with the prefix notation of the input equation. Sample Output:

To run this file, use the .exe file in its directory.
